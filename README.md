Prime and Fib number sequencer

primeFibs

Prime number and Fibonacci sequence calculator

This script will do 4 things: 2 for prime numbers and 2 for the Fibonacci sequence.
Primes

The two things this script does for primes is return a series of prime numbers or determine the primality of a single number. For example, one could find all prime numbers from 2 to 10000 or all prime numbers from 39 to 59.
Fibonacci sequence

The two things this script does for the Fibonacci sequence is return all Fibs numbers up to a given number, or it will return the first (n) Fibs. For example, one could fall all Fibs upt 10000 or the first 10000 Fibs.
WARNING!!

As it stands, this script works out of the box as long as you have Pyhton interpretor installed, but the Fibonacci sequence section will produce a MASSIVE text file if look for the first (n) Fibs. For example, The first 100,000 fibs will create a .txt file that is about 200MB's! On a Core i5 with 8GB of RAM that equates to about 10 minutes to open the file.
